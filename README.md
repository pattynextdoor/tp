Most navigation tools treat your filesystem like a flat list of places you've been. `tp` actually pays attention. It knows which project you're in, remembers your patterns, and — when it's truly stumped — quietly consults an oracle to figure out where you meant to go.

Built in Rust. Works in six shells. Learns from day one. No config required, but every knob is there if you want it.

## Quick Start

```sh
cargo install --path .
eval "$(tp init zsh)"     # or bash, fish, powershell, nushell, elvish
tp init --bootstrap        # import your shell history — useful from minute one
```

Then just use it:

```sh
tp myproject               # jump to best match
tp -p tests                # find tests/ within the current project
tp @payments-service       # switch to a project by name
tp !deploy                 # teleport to a pinned waypoint
tp -i                      # interactive fuzzy picker
```

**tp is useful from the first command.** On first run, it automatically indexes your shell history, imports from zoxide (if installed), and discovers projects under your home directory. No cold start, no manual setup.

---

## Why tp?

Existing tools make you choose: fast-but-dumb or precise-but-manual. `tp` refuses to choose.

| Tool | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| **zoxide** | Fast, Rust, clean UX | No project awareness, no pinning, no AI, cold start |
| **z.lua** | Context-aware jumps | Slower, Lua dependency, no project scoping |
| **fasd** | Tracks files & dirs | Unmaintained since 2015 |
| **fastTravelCLI** | Manual waypoints | No learning, fully manual |

`tp` is what happens when you give zoxide a sense of place, a memory, and a mild case of precognition.

## Features

### Core Navigation

> Free, open source, works entirely offline. No accounts, no cloud, no strings.

- **Frecency scoring** — frequency + recency with time-decay weighting that matches or exceeds zoxide
- **Multi-token fuzzy matching** — `tp foo bar` matches paths containing both tokens
- **Typo tolerance** — `tp projetcs` still finds `projects` via Damerau-Levenshtein fallback (5+ char queries)
- **Project awareness** — auto-detection via `.git`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `go.mod`, and [12 more markers](#project-markers)
- **Project-scoped search** — `tp -p tests` stays inside your project boundaries
- **Cross-project switching** — `tp @payments-service` jumps to a known project root
- **Waypoints** — `tp --mark deploy` pins a directory; `tp !deploy` teleports there instantly
- **Smart cold start** — bootstraps from shell history, git repos, and existing zoxide databases
- **Built-in TUI picker** — interactive fuzzy finder showing project name, last modified, and git branch
- **Full `cd` compatibility** — relative paths, `..`, `-`, `~`, absolute paths all just work
- **6 shells** — bash, zsh, fish, PowerShell, Nushell, Elvish

### AI Features (BYOK)

> Bring your own API key. The tool never phones home unless you ask it to.

- **AI reranking** — when frecency scores are tied, AI considers your cwd and candidate paths to break the tie
- **Session recall** — `tp --recall` answers the Monday morning question: *"where was I?"*
- **Semantic project indexing** *(coming soon)* — search across projects by concept: `tp the service that handles webhook retries`
- **Workflow prediction** *(coming soon)* — spots recurring navigation sequences and nudges you toward the next destination
- **Natural language nav** *(planned)* — `tp the auth service terraform module` resolves even when none of those words appear in the path
- **Smart aliasing** — `tp suggest` recommends waypoint names for your most-visited directories, with optional AI-enhanced naming

### Pro Tier

> For teams. $5–8/seat/month.

- **Cross-machine sync** — frecency database, waypoints, and project index via E2E encrypted cloud storage
- **Team shared waypoints** — canonical navigation shortcuts for the entire org
- **Onboarding mode** — new engineers inherit the team's navigation index on day one
- **Navigation analytics** — personal and team dashboards for usage patterns

## How It Works

Six steps from query to destination. Most trips end at step four.

```
 Query
   │
   ▼
 ┌─────────────────────┐
 │  1. Exact/relative?  │──▶ cd directly
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ no
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │  2. Waypoint (!)?    │──▶ jump to pin
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ no
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │  3. Project (@)?     │──▶ project root
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ no
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │  4. Frecency + fuzzy │──▶ score > 0.8 → go  ← 95% of jumps
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ no matches?
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │ 4b. Typo tolerance   │──▶ Damerau-Levenshtein fallback
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ too close to call
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │  5. AI reranking     │──▶ ~150 tokens, <300ms
 └──────────┬──────────┘
            │ still unsure
 ┌──────────▼──────────┐
 │  6. TUI picker       │──▶ you choose
 └─────────────────────┘
```

The design principle: **AI is a tiebreaker, not a crutch.** Your navigation should never wait on a network request unless it genuinely doesn't know where you want to go.

## Installation

### From source

```sh
cargo install --path .
```

### Shell setup

One line in your shell config:

```sh
# bash (~/.bashrc)
eval "$(tp init bash)"

# zsh (~/.zshrc)
eval "$(tp init zsh)"

# fish (~/.config/fish/config.fish)
tp init fish | source

# PowerShell ($PROFILE)
Invoke-Expression (& { tp init powershell } | Out-String)

# Nushell (~/.config/nushell/env.nu)
tp init nushell | save -f ~/.cache/tp/init.nu; source ~/.cache/tp/init.nu

# Elvish (~/.config/elvish/rc.elv)
eval (tp init elvish | slurp)
```

Want a different command name? Use `--cmd`:

```sh
eval "$(tp init bash --cmd j)"
```

### Bootstrap

**tp auto-bootstraps on first run.** The first time you navigate with an empty database, tp silently:

1. Imports your zoxide database (if zoxide is installed)
2. Parses your shell history (`~/.zsh_history`, `~/.bash_history`, fish history) for `cd` targets
3. Scans common code directories (`~/code`, `~/projects`, `~/repos`, etc.) for project roots

This takes <500ms and means your first `tp` command already has context.

You can also trigger it manually or import from a specific source:

```sh
tp init --bootstrap                                    # re-run auto-discovery
tp import --from=zoxide                                # import from zoxide
tp import --from=zoxide ~/.local/share/zoxide/db.zo    # import from file
```

## Configuration

All via environment variables. Sane defaults — most users won't need to touch these.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TP_DATA_DIR` | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tp` | Database and config location |
| `TP_API_KEY` | — | Anthropic API key for AI features |
| `TP_AI_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | AI model override |
| `TP_AI_TIMEOUT` | `2000` | AI request timeout (ms) |
| `TP_EXCLUDE_DIRS` | — | Comma-separated path prefixes to ignore (supports `~`) |

## Project Markers

`tp` walks up the directory tree looking for these files to detect project boundaries:

`.git` `Cargo.toml` `package.json` `go.mod` `pyproject.toml` `setup.py` `Gemfile` `pom.xml` `build.gradle` `CMakeLists.txt` `Makefile` `.project` `composer.json` `mix.exs` `deno.json` `flake.nix`

## Benchmarks

Measured with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro, 200+ runs each. The benchmark suite tests four scenarios to give a fair picture of both tools.

### Core queries (500 entries, flat seeding)

Raw query speed with 1 visit per path — the simplest comparison.

<p align="center">
<img src="bench/charts/core.svg" alt="Core benchmarks" width="600" />
</p>

### Realistic visit patterns (hot/warm/cold)

300 directories with varied visit counts: 50 "hot" paths (20 visits), 100 "warm" (5 visits), 150 "cold" (1 visit). This exercises frecency ranking under real-world conditions.

<p align="center">
<img src="bench/charts/varied.svg" alt="Varied visit pattern benchmarks" width="600" />
</p>

### Stale path handling

200 directories, 40% deleted after seeding. tp checks `Path::exists()` on every candidate and self-heals stale entries — this costs extra I/O but keeps your results clean.

<img src="bench/charts/stale.svg" alt="Stale path benchmarks" width="600" />
</p>

### Scale (5,000 entries)

Does the speed gap hold at scale?

<img src="bench/charts/scale.svg" alt="Scale benchmarks" width="600" />
</p>

> **Note:** tp's `add` does more work than zoxide's — it detects project roots by walking up the tree for `.git`, `Cargo.toml`, etc., and logs session data. This is the cost of project-scoped search and session recall.

Run the benchmarks yourself:

```sh
cargo build --release
./bench/bench.sh
python3 bench/chart.py   # generate SVG charts
```

## Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="tp architecture diagram" width="574" />
</p>

- **Core** — Rust, <5MB static binary, <5ms local navigation
- **Database** — SQLite with WAL mode, automatic migrations, index optimization
- **AI & TUI** — compile-time feature flags (`--features ai,tui`), both on by default
- **Local-first** — fully functional offline. AI is the fallback, never the hot path.

## Design Principles

- **Local-first, always.** Every navigation is instant by default. The network is a luxury, not a dependency.
- **Invisible intelligence.** Frecency, project context, and AI blend seamlessly. No "modes" to think about.
- **Zero-config magic, full-config power.** Works the moment you install it. Everything overridable for the curious.
- **Respect the developer.** No telemetry without consent. No nagging. No forced accounts. The free tier is the real product.

## Development Status

`tp` is in **beta**. Core navigation, frecency scoring, project detection, waypoints, shell integration, AI reranking, TUI picker, and session recall are all implemented and working.

| Phase | Status | Shipping |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Alpha** | ✅ Complete | Core binary: frecency, project detection, waypoints, 6-shell integration, bootstrap, zoxide import |
| **Beta** | ✅ Complete | AI reranking (BYOK), TUI picker, session recall, smart aliasing, query/remove/doctor commands. CI on 3 platforms. |
| **v1.0** | Planned | Semantic project indexing, workflow prediction, natural language nav, VS Code extension. |
| **Pro** | Planned | Cloud sync, team waypoints, onboarding mode, analytics. |
